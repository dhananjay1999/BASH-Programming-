#Bash Programming 

To Define folder name on which we are working 
#! /usr/bin/bash

1) User Input:

read "username: " username
then input taken on next line

read -p "username: " username
then input taken on same line

while taking password to hide password We take -sp
eg. read -sp "password: " password

2) Array Input:

to get array we use -a flag
read -a names
echo "${names[0]}, ${names[1]}"

after read command if we dont mention any variable name then terminal have 
default variable "REPLY".

to take array we can use 
args=("$@")
echo $@ #### Will print all arguments passed
echo $# #### Will print number of all arguments passed

3)If elif else:

Integer Comparision
-eq - is equal to [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]
-ne - is not equal to 
-gt - greater than
-ge - greater than or equal to 
-lt - less than 
-le - less than or equal to 
<   - is less than
<=  - is less than or equal to 
>   - is greater than
>=  - is greate than or equal to 

String comparisions
=  - is equal to 
== - is equal to 
!= - is not equal to 
-z - string is null, that is, has zero length.
